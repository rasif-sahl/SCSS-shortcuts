# Breakpoints

You can find for the example for this section in.
`Example/index.jsx` and you can fine the SCSS file in `Example/index.scss`.

If you need to check how this is working. First you will have to set-up this in your local mashing as I mentioned in the `README.md`.

And then you can check this by copying and pasting this URL in the browser. `http://localhost:3000/`.

And then once you are ready you can use the code what is included in the `Example/index.scss` file and then change it according to your code.

And also keep in mind that you will need to copy the code what is there in the `breakpoints.scss` file and add the same code somewhere in the your code.

And when you are using this functionality you can `@import '../breakPoints.scss';` use import command something similar to this.
