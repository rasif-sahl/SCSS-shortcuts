You can find for the example for this section in.
`Example/index.jsx` and you can fine the SCSS file in `Example/index.scss`.

If you need to check how this is working. First you will have to set-up this in your local mashing as I mentioned in the `README.md`.

And then you can check this by copying and pasting this URL in the browser. `http://localhost:3000/`.

And then once you are ready you can use the code what is included in the `Example/index.scss` file and then change it according to your code.
